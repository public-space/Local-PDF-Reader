# Local-PDF-Reader
A PDF reader with functionality like goddamn bookmarking for free on my local machine. Plan to move it to a server so files can be hosted and settings such as highlighting, bookmarks, etc can be accessed elsewhere. Tagging between books and cross references to other books would be amazing and i plan on implementing that. But just the basics for now
